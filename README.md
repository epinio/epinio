## What problem does Epinio solve?

Epinio makes it easy for developers to iterate on their applications running in Kubernetes. Easy means:

- No experience with Kubernetes is required
- No steep learning curve
- Quick local setup with minimal configuration
- Deploying to production similar to development

Kubernetes is becoming the de-facto standard for container orchestration.
Developers may want to use Kubernetes for all the benefits it provides or may
have to do so because that's what their Ops team has chosen. Whatever the case,
using Kubernetes is not simple. It has a steep learning curve and doing it right
is a full time job. Developers should spend their time working on their applications,
not doing operations.

Epinio is adding the needed abstractions and intelligence to allow Developers
to use Kubernetes as a PaaS (Platform as a Service).

## Documentation

Installation and user documentation is available at our main [docs.epinio.io](https://docs.epinio.io/) site.

Our [developer documentation](./docs) explains how to build and run Epinio from a source checkout.

## Features

- **Security**
  - mTLS: Epinio uses `linkerd` to secure all communication between epinio components inside the kubernetes cluster
  - Basic Authentication to access the API
- **Epinio Clients**
  - Web UI
  - Epinio CLI
- **Apps**
  - Push code directly without additional tools or steps
  - Basic operation of your application once pushed
  - Cloud Native Buildpacks build and containerize your code for you
- **Services**
  - CRUD operations of your service. A service can be a database, SaaS etc. A service can be an external component or can be created using `epinio service`
  - Bind services to apps

## Usage

- [QuickStart](https://docs.epinio.io/tutorials/quickstart.html) - Tutorial on how to create a namespace and push an application.

## Buildpacks

Buildpacks convert your application source code into container images in which the buildpack provides the framework, dependencies and runtime support for your app based on it's programming language.

Epinio uses [Paketo Buildpacks](https://paketo.io/docs/) through tekton pipelines to convert your source code into container images. 

[Tekton Buildpack Pipeline](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/blob/main/task/buildpacks/0.3/buildpacks.yaml) - Epinio uses this tekton pipeline with the Paketo's full [Builder Image](https://paketo.io/docs/concepts/builders/).

[Using Custom Buildpack](./docs/developer/howtos/custom-python-builder.md) - Steps to create and use a custom builder image that includes a buildpack for Python (The paketo  full [Builder Image](https://paketo.io/docs/concepts/builders/) doesn't support python apps yet).
